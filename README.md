## Installation

Download from [here](https://github.com/brigonzalez/Mockingbird/releases/download/1.0.0/Mockingbird.1.0.0.dmg)

**NOTE**: Your Mac may ask you for permission to allow the app to "monitor input from your keyboard even while using other apps." This functionality is necessary only to show and hide the app using the ⌘⇧v (command + shift + v) keyboard shortcut from anywhere on your Mac.

## Instructions

Any time you copy a string of text while Mockingbird is running, the text will automatically be saved to the Mockingbird app clipboard.

To **copy** text from the Mockingbird app you can:
* double click on the text you'd like to copy
* arrow up or down to the text and hit enter to copy
* use the keyboard shortcut next to the text to copy

A green keyboard shortcut to the left of the text indicates the text that is currently copied to your clipboard.

To **delete** text from the Mockingbird app you can:
* click on the "x" on the right side of the text -- the "x" appears when you hover the mouse over the right side of the text
* arrow up or down to the text and use the ⌘⌦ (command + delete/backspace) keyboard shortcut
* use the ⌘⇧⌦ (command + shift + delete/backspace) keyboard shortcut to **delete all** of the text on the clipboard
