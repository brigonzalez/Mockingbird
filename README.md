Mockingbird stores up to 20 strings of text.

To **copy** text you can:
* double click on the text you'd like to copy
* arrow up or down to the text and hit enter to copy
* use the keyboard shortcut next to the text to copy

A green keyboard shortcut to the left of the text indicates the text that is currently copied to your clipboard.

To **delete** text you can:
* click on the "x" on the right side of the text -- the "x" appears when you hover the mouse over the right side of the text
* arrow up or down to the text and use the ⌘⌦ (command + delete/backspace) shortcut
* use the ⌘⇧⌦ keyboard shortcut to **delete all** of the text on the clipboard
